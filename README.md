# Wiper - Disk cleanup tool

Wiper is a handy command-line tool made with Rust. It's perfect for anyone looking to quickly spot which folders are eating up all the disk space. Super easy to use, it gives you a clear visual breakdown of directory sizes, so you can clean things up without a hassle.

## Why not [dua-cli](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli)?
I started this project as part of my journey to learn Rust. I always missed having such a tool but had never heard of dua-cli. From my understanding, there are some differences:

#### Pros:
- Wiper allows navigating to the parent directory at any time
- Supports opening files with the default system app
- Simpler deletion flow

#### Cons:
- It is 10-15 times slower because of manually implemented file traversal. I plan to rewrite it in the same way as dua-cli (with `jwalk`)
- Does not have filtering functionality
- Not capable of marking multiple entries for deletion

#### Subjective:
- The UI is more "elegant" :)
- Shows a "full" space-taken bar for the largest entry. So there will always be at least one entry with a full bar. If dua-cli has two large entries of similar size, they will be shown as approximately 50% bars.
